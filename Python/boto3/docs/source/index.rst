Boto 3 Documentation
====================
Boto is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python, which allows Python
developers to write software that makes use of Amazon services like S3 and
EC2. Boto provides an easy to use, object-oriented API as well as low-level
direct service access.

.. note::

   Boto 3 is in **developer preview**.  This means that until a 1.0 release
   occurs, some of the interfaces may change based on your feedback. Once a
   1.0 release happens, we guarantee backwards compatibility for all future
   1.x.x releases.  Try out Boto 3 and give us
   `feedback <https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues>`__ today!
